# React Metronome
This is a project created from a tutorial by Dave Ceddia found here: https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/

## Getting set up: 
You can clone this repo, cd into its directory on the terminal, and then use the command 'npm start'

## This project: 
This is a very short project used as a first attempt at using audio objects with react. You are able to set your own BPM between 60 to 240 with the slider, and then you are able to stop and start the metronome. After finishing the tutorial, I added to this project the ability to change the number of beats per bar as well.
